# Problem Statement: Customize Your Game Character! (A Fun RPG Example)
Scenario:
You’re designing a mini RPG (Role-Playing Game) where players start with a basic character, and can equip items like:
- Armor
- Magic Cloak
- Ring of Invisibility
- Power Sword
- Jetpack (hey, why not?)

Each item enhances the character’s powers (adds defense, attack, stealth, speed, etc.).
And you should be able to add/remove equipment dynamically
 — no subclassing like WizardWithSwordAndCloakAndInvisibilityRing.java

# Problem Statement for Class

"Design a system where a basic game character can be decorated with different equipment.
Each piece of equipment adds new abilities or stats (attack, defense, speed, stealth, etc.).
The player can mix and match equipment at runtime, and every time we ask the character to describe(),
it should print their updated capabilities."
