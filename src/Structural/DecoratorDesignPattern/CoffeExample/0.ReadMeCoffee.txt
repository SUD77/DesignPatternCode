# Imagine you order a coffee:
- You start with a plain coffee.
- Then you add milk.
- Then sugar.
- Then maybe whipped cream (because youâ€™re feeling fancy).

Each addition wraps the original coffee and adds more functionality (flavor, cost, calories ðŸ˜…).
You didnâ€™t subclass CoffeeWithMilk, CoffeeWithSugar, CoffeeWithCream, etc. You just decorated the base coffee with layers.
