- Note : VehicleExample is taken from shrayans coding-concept LLD playlist.

Here, in WithoutStartegyPattern -

- Vehicle class has drive capability function.
- Different type of Vehicles implement the parent vehicle.
- Either they can implement the drive capability given by Vehicle class or implement their own.
- Suppose, two child class (offRoad and Sports ) want to implement, Sports driving capability,
- Now, both will write their own implementation.
- Duplicate code is written and that's bad.
- Implementing Strategy Design pattern can resolve it.


Now, WithStartegy Design Pattern

- We have startegy folder, where we have implemented different startegies.
- If we want we can add later.
- In vehicle class, constructor is abstract. Because of this Child classes can pass their own strategies as per their
convenience
