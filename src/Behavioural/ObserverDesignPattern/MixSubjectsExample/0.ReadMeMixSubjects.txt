#Note

- Adding this example to show one complex problem where subject interface is implemented by many concrete subjects

# Smart Home System

You're teaching a class about building a Smart Home System.
There are different device types (Subjects):
- Thermostat – publishes temperature.
- SecurityCamera – publishes motion detection.
- DoorSensor – publishes door open/close events.

Then there are Apps or Modules (Observers):
- MobileApp – wants updates from all devices.
- SecuritySystem – only cares about motion and door.
- EnergySaverModule – only listens to the thermostat.

Each subject is a separate class (not subclassed from one shared concrete class).

# Design Goal

- Different Subject classes (not instances of the same class).
- Each Subject has its own logic and data.
- Observers implement a common interface, but behavior varies.
- Clear abstraction, good for class discussions and extension.
