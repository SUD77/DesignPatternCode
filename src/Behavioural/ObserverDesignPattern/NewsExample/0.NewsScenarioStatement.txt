Imagine you run a platform like a News Aggregator (e.g., Flipboard or Google News).
There are multiple news channels (Subjects):
- CNN
- ESPN
- TechCrunch

There are also multiple subscribers (Observers):
- Alice subscribes to CNN and ESPN.
- Bob subscribes to TechCrunch.
- Charlie subscribes to all three.

When a news channel publishes a new article, only its own subscribers are notified.
This is a classic example of multiple Subjects and multiple Observers.

# Design Overview

We want:
- A common Subject interface for channels.
- A common Observer interface for subscribers.
- Clean separation of responsibilities.
- Support for multiple subjects and multiple observers.
